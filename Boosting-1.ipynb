    "Boosting is an ensemble machine learning technique that aims to improve the performance of weak learners (often referred to as \"base\" or \"weak\" models) by combining them into a single strong learner. Unlike bagging methods like Random Forest, boosting focuses on sequential training, where each subsequent model tries to correct the mistakes made by its predecessors. Boosting algorithms assign higher weights to misclassified instances, making the subsequent models pay more attention to those examples, thus improving the overall performance."
